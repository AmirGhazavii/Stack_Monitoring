# Stack_Monitoring
Full Stack Monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus — updated daily! This is the first version of the project, and I’m continuously working on it and adding new features. For your convenience, the entire stack is automated and deployable using Ansible — just run it and you’re good to go.
